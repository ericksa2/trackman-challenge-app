# Trackman Challenge App #

The purpose of this mini application is to provide a means of displaying various golf venues. The user is also able to create, edit, and delete. All data is stored within the app and no external endpoints are hooked up at this time.


# To Run #

To start application, enter the following into the terminal:
  'npm i'
  'npm run dev'
Then click the link to open the localhost in the browser.


# Future Improvements #

If I were to make this into a fully-fledged app I would make the following improvements:
  Create data services to read from backend endpoints
  Add unit tests
  Either find a proper form library which supports easy validation or create a custom framework
